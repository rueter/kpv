# Introduction
The Komi-Zyrian to x dictionary has its origins in Komi language studies at the University of Helsinki 1994, in the form of the **𐍩̈𐍥𐍚𐍐𐍜𐍩̈𐍥𐍚𐍐, 𐍙𐍤𐍩̈𐍢 𐍚𐍔𐍮𐍮𐍩𐍠 𐍚𐍩𐍜𐍙𐍐-𐍐𐍝𐍒𐍛𐍙𐍡𐍚𐍩̈𐍐-𐍟𐍙𐍝𐍡𐍚𐍩̈𐍐 ** [ӧшка-мӧшка ичӧт кыввор комиа-англискӧя-финскӧя] 'Rainbow vocabulary Komi-English-Finnish'.

As an increment part of finite-state description of the Komi-Zyrian language, the dictionary of over 29,700 entries with Russian as well as partial Finnish and English translation has been used in corpus analyses at both the Norwegian Arctic University, Giellatekno (Tromsø, Norway) http://gtweb.uit.no/u_korp/ and FU-lab (Syktyvkar, Komi Republic, Russian Federation) [http://komicorpora.ru/](http://komicorpora.ru/), [https://dict.fu-lab.ru/dict?id=5109](https://dict.fu-lab.ru/dict?id=5109).

# Acknowledgments

Special thanks are extended to Komi language specialist and facilitators Evgeni Tsypanov, Sergei Gabov, Vera Chernikh, Paula Kokkonen, who have provided invaluable contributions to the initial work, and workers at FU-Lab in Syktyvkar Marina Fedina, Önjö Lav who have continuously provided morphological and lexical work in Komi.

The Giellatekno infrastructure has begun implementing work with Komi-Zyrian in 2004, and work with this lexicon is shared directly in development on that infrastructure. Thanks to Trond Trosterud, Sjur Moshagen, Ciprian Gerstenberger et al.

Subsequent extensions of the work have been financed by scholarships:
Work with the Komi-Zyrian lexicon, native evaluation and mobility (Jack Rueter), has been further funded by a Kordelin Foundation in 1996.

The Kone Foundation in Helsinki (Language Programme 2013-2017) provided funding for Paula Kokkonen to translate Komi-Russian dictionary work (2012-2016) for a total of 2 years and 8 months -- 2012/1-8, 2014/5-8, 2015/5-12 and 2016/1-12.
